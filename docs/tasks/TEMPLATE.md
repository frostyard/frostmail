# T-NNNN: Imperative title

## Goal

Two to four sentences: what exists afterwards and why it matters.

## Read first

- Each file the executor must read, and what to look for in it.
- docs/tasks/EXECUTOR.md

## Contract

Exact signatures, file names, output formats and error behavior. Anything the
given tests check must be stated here in words too.

## Tests (given, do not edit)

The given files and their test names.

## Gotchas

Traps a model is likely to fall into for this task.

## Out of scope

What not to do, even if it looks related.

## Done when

`make accept T=NNNN` passes, `make check` passes, and only the files under
touch changed.
